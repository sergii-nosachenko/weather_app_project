# Weather Mobile App

![Weather App](https://colorfully.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/weather-forecast-facebook-cover.jpg)

Your goal is to create a mobile app that displays the current weather and forecast for the selected location.

## Technologie stack

- App logic: [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- Data fetching & store: [React Query](https://react-query-v3.tanstack.com/), [Tutorial for using with React Native](https://blog.logrocket.com/react-query-state-management-react-native/)
- Persistent app storage: [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage)
- Project management:
  - React Native CLI - harder to setup and work with but better for big projects
  - Expo CLI - easier to set up and work with, but has some limitations (recommended option)
    - [Pros & cons for both CLIs](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/react-native-cli-vs-expo-cli-which-one-do-i-choose-bdf02ea457bf)
    - [Setup process](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- [Typescript](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/typescript/)
- [ESLint, Prettier, and Pre-commit](https://dev-yakuza.posstree.com/en/react-native/eslint-prettier-husky-lint-staged/)

## Roadmap

- Setup your development environment
- Initialize an empty project
- Create a GitHub repo and connect it to your project
- Install all necessary dependencies
- Configure typescript, linter, prettier, etc
- Create a dummy screen with the `Hello world!` text and run it. Check if all works correctly.
- Choose a template, icons, color theme, and APIs (read the next chapter)
- Register and get API keys. Test APIs at their playgrounds or use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- Write a step-by-step plan for your development. **Add a realistic deadline to your calendar!** It will take 2-3 working days to complete this task.
- Start the development, feature-by-feature, commit-by-commit (remember, you need to have a nice commit history!).
- Test your application
- When completed, create an extended `readme.md` file ([example](https://gist.github.com/solaryasha/0fb46a864b490afd618f2c4751a65041), [constructor](https://readme.so/))
- Deploy your project so it can be viewed online (Expo provides you with a great tool to deploy)
- Ask a mentor to give you feedback
- Add project to your portfolio
- Profit!
